# Comparitive-Analysis-of-various-classifiers-for-Gesture-Recognition
This project uses 7 Machine Learning classifiers to recognize the gestures made by the users. The gestures are that of capital alphabet letters. Apart from this, Arduino and MPU-6050 have been used to record the data set and train the models.
